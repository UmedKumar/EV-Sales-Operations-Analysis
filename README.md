Performed an end-to-end analysis of the ElectricPe sales and operations funnel.

1.  **Data Analysis:** Started by cleaning the raw data, then used Excel Pivot Tables to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) for each store. This included:
    * Conversion Rates (Lead $\rightarrow$ Pre-Booking $\rightarrow$ Booking $\rightarrow$ Delivery)
    * Average Turnaround Time (TAT) for each stage
    * Net Promoter Score (NPS)
    * Cancellation reasons
    * A high-potential lead list

2.  **Dashboarding:** Compiled all this analysis into a single, interactive dashboard using PivotCharts. This included a funnel chart for conversions, bar charts for TAT and customer ratings, and a stacked bar chart for cancellation reasons, allowing a manager to see all metrics at a glance.

3.  **Storytelling & Recommendations:** Finally, Interpreted the data to tell a story. Identified a critical bottleneck (`Store C`) whose high delivery TAT was directly causing high cancellations and a very low NPS. Tehen built a set of actionable recommendations to fix this, such as auditing the problem store and implementing a "Hot Lead" follow-up protocol.
